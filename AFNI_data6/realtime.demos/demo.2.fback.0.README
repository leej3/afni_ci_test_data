In order to run this "feedback" demo (demo.2.fback),
consider using 3 terminal windows so that you can see
all output independently (from the receiver, from afni,
and from the data feeding program).

In terminal A: ./demo.2.fback.1.receiver
(and leave this running).

Then in terminal B: ./demo.2.fback.2.afni
(this can also be left running).

Then in terminal C: ./demo.2.fback.3.feedme
(this can be run multiple times to repeat the demo).
