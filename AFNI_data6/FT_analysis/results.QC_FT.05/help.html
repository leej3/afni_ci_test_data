<div  style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: -0px;"  class='container'  ><pre><b>QC organization
    The quality control (QC) is organized into thematic blocks to
    check, such as original data acquisition, different alignments,
    motion, regression modeling, and more. At the top of the QC page,
    there is a navigation bar with a label for each QC block (vorig,
    ve2a, etc.) that functions as a button to the top of that section.

Rating
    Beneath each section label is a(n initially empty) QC button,
    which users can click to set a rating for that QC block and for
    the overall subject rating ("FINAL"). Clicking on the QC button
    toggles its state through good (+), bad (X) or other (?, which may
    include 'ugly', or just a hint to revisit later).  Users can also
    use convenient 'filler buttons' at the right (A+, Ax, etc.), when
    the ratings are constant/uniform-- one hopes for 'all good'
    processing, but who knows...

Commenting
    Additionally, users can ctrl+click on the QC button to enter a
    comment for that block.  For example, they can write why a rating
    was good or bad, or what question they have led them to rate it as
    'other'.

Saving
    Clicking SAVE will let the user save the QC ratings+comments on
    their computer for later use, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria
    for the subject in group analysis.  (NB: This action is treated
    the same as downloading a file from online, and is subject to
    standard limitations on simplicity due to browser security
    settings.)</b></pre></div>

<div  style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: -0px;"  class='container'  ><pre><b>QC block 
    One thematic section of the QC form (original data, alignment
    step, etc.).  Each block has a label in the navigation bar (vorig,
    ve2a, etc.)-- click on the label to jump to that block. Click on
    the button below the label to provide a rating for that block.

QC button
    Below each QC block label in the navigation bar is a button
    (initially empty after running afni_proc.py). The user can click
    on it to toggle its state to one of three ratings (good, +; bad,
    X; other, ?), as well as to enter a comment for that QC block (via
    ctrl+click).

'FINAL' 
    Label for the QC button to hold the user's overall/final
    evaluation of the subject's data and processing. (Clicking on this
    label does nothing.)

filler button 
    |A+|, |Ax|, |A?|-- located in the upper right corner of the
    navigation menu.  These can be used to provide uniform ratings
    across the QC buttons (click to fill empty buttons, double-click
    to fill *all* buttons, regardless of state).  
    |clr|-- double-clicking on this will empty all ratings+comments
    from the QC buttons.

'SAVE'
    Write the ratings+comments to disk.  This action is done through
    the browser, and is subject to the browser settings; probably
    users should not have the browser set to automatically download
    all files to the same location, for example.

'HELP'
    Button : well, how did you get here??

'BC', 'AC'
    When using the 'pythonic' HTML style, 1D-plotting (like motion
    enorm plots) also produces boxplots to summarize values.  When
    censoring has been applied, by default there will be two boxplots
    made: one of values 'before censoring' (BC), and one of values
    'after censoring' (AC).  Those labels are affixed in order to the
    titles of the boxplots.

<div  style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: -0px;"  class='container'  ><pre><b>
To record an evaluation, click the button below any section label, and
toggle through:
    + : good,
    X : bad,
    ? : other (or 'revisit').

For speed, you can click 'filler button' |A+| once to fill all *empty*
buttons with +, or doubly to fill *all* buttons with +.  |Ax| behaves
the same for X, and |A?| for ?.

Double-click |clr| to clear all rating and comment values.

Pro-tip: if data are mostly all in a single state like good or bad,
just use filler buttons to save yourself click time, and then just
click any individual buttons that are different.  </b></pre></div>

Use ctrl+click on a QC button to open (or close) a comment window.  

Save a comment with the green (left) button, or hit Enter at any point.
Remove a comment with the pink (right) button, or hit Esc at any point.

Any QC button with a comment gets a pair of quotes added, like ''+''.
Comments are independent of rating, but adding a comment to an empty
button changes its rating to ''?'' (which can be altered further from
there).
