      ------- single subject processing : subject FT ------

These description files can be used as a guide to review the analysis methods
for processing single subject data.  While afni_proc.py is used to generate the
processing script, the important things are to understand the script (which one
could write by hand) and the resulting data (from each processing step).

Commands are shown following '% ' prompts.

These are text files.  If you want pretty pictures, please review the class
handout.

Start by reading the first 8 pages of the handout, at least.  This document
covers the class work (looking at the files and data).  The experiment design
and background on afni_proc.py are not covered here.

Recall that the afni_proc.py processing script will:

   1. set some variables
   2. create a results directory
   3. copy all input to the results directory
   4. do the processing

So the results directory can be deleted without losing any original data.

This tutorial was written based on the processing scripts from afni_proc.py 
version 2.33 (see "afni_proc.py -ver").  More recent updates to afni_proc.py 
will not be reflected (unless I get sufficient hate-mail).
