todo:
   - getting betas (and maybe t-stats) to standard space
        - keep it simple, send the whole stats dataset...
        - 4 cases: @auto or manual, @ volreg or after processing
   - continue on with some group analysis (see AFNI_data6/group_results)
        - 3dANOVA2
        - 3dMEMA (maybe just V-A)

done:
   2010-07-28 : everything up through t16, understanding the X-matrix
   2010-11-16 : added t17 through t20 (view results through post regress)
   2011-03-08 : added t20_montage.txt (renamed post regress to t21)
